# 	CP SETUP

Python script to initialise setup for codeforces competitive programming competitions.

### What does it do?

It asks you for the competition number and div and  makes a folder with all the basic problem cpp files like "a.cpp" , "b.cpp" etc. intialised with my basic programming template
and opens the files using sublime text


### Setup and Running

Have python 3 installed and configure bash alias to open sublime text by typing "subl" or tweak the script to your own code editor preferences

Put your own template in ```template.txt``` or just use my deafult
It takes input from ```input.txt``` and outputs to ```output.txt``` which will also be automatically created

Navigate to the directory you want to have the folder in and
Run
```
python3 setup.py
```
